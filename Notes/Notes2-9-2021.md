### Notes

	* Daily Stand-up - Do one for case study and one for daily.
	* Questions to answer are what did I do yesterday?
	* What do I plan to learn today?
	* What obstacles have I faced?

What did you learn yesterday? 

1. I learned types of operators. The differences of Unary, Binary and Ternary.

2. When we would use bitwise XOR or NOR.

3. The difference between reference data-types and primitive data-types.

What are you planning to learn today?

1. I'm planning on learning how to iterate through arrays in javaScript.

2. How to build a calculator for exercise.  

3. How to use different array methods like array slice.

Are there any impediments in your way?

No.

### Look into

-  different data-structures
 
 
### Side comment
- object is data type and can be referenced.
