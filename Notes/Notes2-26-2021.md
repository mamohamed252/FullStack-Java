### Notes

	* Daily Stand-up - Do one for case study and one for daily.
	* Questions to answer are what did I do yesterday?
	* What do I plan to learn today?
	* What obstacles have I faced?

What did you learn yesterday?Â 

1. How to short circuit operators for boolean and how to assign an operation to a boolean to make print statements easier to read.

2. I learned the difference between nested and chained if/else statements. Chained statements are generally easier to read.

3. Curly braces are usually seen in an if/else block but not necessary if you know what you're looking for.

What are you planning to learn today?

1. Go through loop control statements, arrays, and methods/ object slide decks.

2. Finish Java exercise assignment in paired programming.

3. Learn about abstraction interface vs interfaces.

Are there any impediments in your way?

No.
