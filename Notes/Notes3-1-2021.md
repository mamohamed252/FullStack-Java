### Notes

	* Daily Stand-up - Do one for case study and one for daily.
	* Questions to answer are what did I do yesterday?
	* What do I plan to learn today?
	* What obstacles have I faced?

What did you learn yesterday?Â 

1. The difference of static array and dynamic arrays. Dynamic arrays will expand as needed.

2. How to loop through using Do while, While and for loop. Used different problems to find out which loop is better use for a problem.

3. Programming languages provide flow-control structures that allow more complicated execution paths.

What are you planning to learn today?

1. Go through loop control statements, arrays, and methods/ object slide decks.

2. Continue Java paired programming.

3. Learn about abstraction interface vs interfaces.

Are there any impediments in your way?

No.
