### Notes

	* Daily Stand-up - Do one for case study and one for daily.
	* Questions to answer are what did I do yesterday?
	* What do I plan to learn today?
	* What obstacles have I faced?

What did you learn yesterday? 

1. How to create private methods and access them in the main method. Also how to cast different data types.

2. Started to learn binary and bit-wise.

3. What left shift and the right shift do.

What are you planning to learn today?

1. Practice on binary.

2. Finish 2nd, 3rd, and begin the 4th Java exercise assignment.

3. Learn how to do more algorithms in Java.

Are there any impediments in your way?

No.
