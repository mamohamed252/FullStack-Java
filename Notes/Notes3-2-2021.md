### Notes

	* Daily Stand-up - Do one for case study and one for daily.
	* Questions to answer are what did I do yesterday?
	* What do I plan to learn today?
	* What obstacles have I faced?

3/2/2021

What did you learn yesterday?Â 

1. I learned classes implement interfaces. Superclass defines the expected behavior (public interface) of all subclasses.

2. Method does not need a return value, it declares a return type void.

3. Method declaration is broken down to Access Specifier(public, private, protected default), Return type (void, any valid data-type), Method Name(any valid identifier), Formal Parameters (a comma-delimited list of data-type, name)

What are you planning to learn today?

1. Core Java inheritance.

2. Continue Java paired programming.

3. What classes are. Access Specifiers, constructors, and encapsulation.

Are there any impediments in your way?

No.
